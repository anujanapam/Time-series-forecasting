# Business Analytics Application: 
Time series forecasting is highly used in business. A company can forecast its sales, demands of customers, stock returns, exchange rate etc. By forecasting 
the values, the company can manage its future plan and perspectives.

## DATA: 
China Trade data shows statistics of US imports from China from year 1990 to 2012. The data is published by US Census Bureau, Foreign Trade Division. 
It is yearly data for 23 years. The amount of imports rose after 2000. There is an upward shift in import in recent period.

### DESCRIPTION: 
Products sold, Daily Covid Cases, GDP of an economy, Daily exchange rate etc.--- are saved throughout a time period (say, monthly, yearly, daily etc). 
These are called Time Series Data. We take the values that are given and then forecast or predict values for some future period. We fit trend lines. There are some 
rules for fitting the trend line:
i. Values are increasing at a constant rate ---- linear trend line (example- Annual Salary increments)
ii. Values are increasing at an increasing rate --- Exponential or Power (example- Covid cases during the beginning of 2nd wave in India)
iii. Values are increasing at a decreasing rate --- Logarithmic trend line (example- After reaching a certain level, the growth rate of an economy flattens i.e. at steady sate)
iv. Both increasing and decreasing—Polynomial trend line (example- Covid cases of last 16 months of India)

#### RESULTS & DISCUSSIONS: 
For Time Series Forecasting, MS EXCEL is the best and easiest way to analyse.
The value of 𝑅2 is the measure of the “fit” of the line. The larger the value of 𝑅2, the better the fit.We have found the different trend line equations 
from EXCEL. We have taken polynomial of 2nd and 3rd order. Higher order equations make the calculations complex.
LINEAR                           y=19.545x-68.394                              𝑅^2=0.9188
EXPONENTIAL                    y=17.062e^0.1525x                               𝑅^2=0.9792
LOGARITHMIC                   y=134.33ln(x)-136.35                             𝑅^2=0.6505 
POLYNOMIAL(2nd order)        y=0.8297(x)^2-0.4601x+14.581                      𝑅^2=0.9773 
POLYNOMIAL(3rd order)      y=-0.0325(x)^3+1.9984(x)^2-11.919x+39.902           𝑅^2=0.9803
POWER                           y=7.0652(x)^1.2087                             R^2=0.913

We can clearly observe that, 𝑅2 value is maximum on Polynomial of 3rd order. This equation can best fit the model. We have also drawn trend line on the line diagram.
POLYNOMIAL(3rd order)
Forested Value(2015)           509.7064
Forested Value(2016)           535.2251
Forecasted Value(2018)         582.2629
For 2015, the value of x is 23+3=26, for 2016, it is 27 and so on…

##### RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: 
It provides future predictions to the company or business. For a certain year, a company can predict its sales figures. This a very useful tool for 
the company for long-term planning.
